## Malhotra Pig Heart Transplant Model
Determined the optimal values for a succesful porcine cardiac xenotransplantation (pig-to-human heart transplant) based on some advanced differential equations that I simplified to model the blood flow rates of the pig heart and the human circulatory/cardiovascular system as a function of some interdependent variables such as kinematic blood viscosity, cross-sectional blood vessel area (as radius and diameter), and blood density. Thus I graphed and modeled these systems and found the certain value ranges which the blood flow rates overlapped to conclude the values that these variables should be set at for a succesful xenotransplantation. 

## Solar Production Model
This program compares solar production to theory by analyzing solar power based on degrees, local solar time, the amount of solar irradiance on the solar panels, and the final theoretical production for thw array of panels. The theoretical/computationally determined data was then compared with recorded data from different times in the summer. Data was reorganized into a matrix. The theoretical/computationally determined data and the actual recorded data were then graphed and visualized for a clear graphical comparison. There is an accompanying Excel spreadsheet under the name SolarArrayProduction.xlsx.

## Minnesota Weather
Analyzed the weather of Minnesota to separate hot days and cold days and perform linear regression to find a line of best fit and also calculate the maximum and minimum snow that Minnesota received. 

## Epidemiology Model
Created a multivariable differential equations-based epidemiology model in MATLAB. 

## ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations)
Explored using, performing operations with, and graphing and visualizing differential equations and systems of differential equations in MATLAB. 

## Grades LS 
This script analyzes some data on grades. Reads in data in table format and performs several mathematical operations to make conclusions about the grades data.
