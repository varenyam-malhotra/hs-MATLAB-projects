## Malhotra Pig Heart Transplant Model
Determined the optimal values for a succesful porcine cardiac xenotransplantation (pig-to-human heart transplant) based on some advanced differential equations that I simplified to model the blood flow rates of the pig heart and the human circulatory/cardiovascular system as a function of some interdependent variables such as kinematic blood viscosity, cross-sectional blood vessel area (as radius and diameter), and blood density. Thus I graphed and modeled these systems and found the certain value ranges which the blood flow rates overlapped to conclude the values that these variables should be set at for a succesful xenotransplantation. 

## Minnesota Weather
Analyzed the weather of Minnesota to separate hot days and cold days and perform linear regression to find a line of best fit and also calculate the maximum and minimum snow that Minnesota received. 

## Grades LS 
This script analyzes some data on grades. Reads in data in table format and performs several mathematical operations to make conclusions about the grades data.
